## Getting Start

```bash
npm install react-simple-chatbot --save
```

## Usage

There are several examples on the [website](http://lucasbassetti.com.br/react-simple-chatbot). Here is the first one to get you started:


```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
```
